            "vegetables and legumes\n" +

            "lean meat, fish, poultry, eggs, nuts, legumes.\n" +

            "Lollies, chocolates, soft drinks, cakes, chips and the like do not fit into the food groups. That’s because, as tempting as they are, your body doesn’t actually need them. \n" +
            "\n" +
            "How much do I need to eat?\n" +
            "When you are pregnant you don’t actually need to “eat for two”. Instead, it’s the quality of your diet that’s important – not how much you eat.\n" +

            "Avoid listeria contamination\n" +
            "You can get a listeria infection from eating contaminated food.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "The listeria bacteria (opens in a new window) are found in nature and in some foods, both home-cooked and bought food. While listeria infection is uncommon and causes few or no symptoms in healthy people, it can be very dangerous.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "If you get a listeria infection during your pregnancy, there is a high risk that it will be transmitted to your unborn child. Listeria infection of the fetus can lead to miscarriage, still birth, premature birth or can make a newborn baby very ill.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "You can lower the risk of listeria contamination by:\n" +
            "\n" +
            "taking simple food hygiene steps at home\n" +
            "being careful about food made by others\n" +
            "avoiding certain high-risk foods including ready-to-eat chilled foods such as cold deli meats, pâté and soft cheeses like Brie.\n" +
            "Limit certain types of fish\n" +
            "Fish is a good source of nutrients for you and your baby, but some types of fish should be limited because they can be high in mercury and affect the baby’s developing nervous system. These include:\n" +
            "\n" +
            "shark (flake), swordfish, marlin and broadbill – limit to one serve per fortnight\n" +
            "sea perch, orange roughy and catfish – limit to one serve per week.\n" +
            "In both cases, you should only eat these fish if you haven’t eaten any other fish during that period.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Limit caffeine\n" +
            "Tea, coffee and cola drinks contain various amounts of the stimulant caffeine, so it’s best to limit the amount of caffeine drinks you have each day.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Avoid alcohol\n" +
            "Because alcohol can have an effect on the development of your baby, no alcohol at all is the safest choice if you are pregnant, or planning to get pregnant.\n" +

            "Breastfeeding\n" +
            "Breastmilk contains everything your baby needs for the first six months of life, so exclusive breastfeeding during this time is recommended to help with your baby’s healthy growth and development.\n" +

            "Why am I so hungry?\n" +
            "Here’s a curious fact… making breastmilk for your baby actually uses more energy than any stage of your pregnancy. No wonder you may feel hungrier than usual.\n" +

            "low-fat yoghurt with fruit.\n" +

            "\n" +
            "What about caffeine and alcohol while breastfeeding?\n" +
            "Some caffeine from coffee, tea and cola drinks will pass into your breast milk, but small amounts are not thought to be harmful. Limit the amount of drinks containing caffeine to no more than two or three cups a day.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Alcohol, like most drugs, can also be passed on to your baby through breastmilk. Not drinking alcohol while breastfeeding is the safest option.\n" +

            "\n" +
            "If you smoke and are breastfeeding, some of the nicotine and poisons from cigarettes are passed to the baby through breastmilk. The best thing you can do for your baby is cut down or quit.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "If you can’t manage this, you should keep breastfeeding, because it will help protect your baby against sickness. You should breastfeed your baby just before smoking to reduce the amount of nicotine your baby will get in breast milk.\n" +

Avoid preparing a different meal for your toddler. Remember, ‘carer provides, child decides’.
